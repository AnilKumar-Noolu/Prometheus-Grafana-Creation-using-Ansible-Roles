In This Repo, we will try to setup Prometheus and Grafana using Roles in Ansible

In Ansible, roles are a way of organizing a collection of related tasks, files, templates, and variables into a reusable and shareable unit. 

They provide a structure for organizing playbooks and enable the creation of reusable, modular, and well-documented playbooks.

Roles can be used to encapsulate reusable functionality across different playbooks, and can also be shared across different teams or organizations. 

They can also be installed and managed via Ansible Galaxy, a repository of community-maintained roles.

# Advantages of using Ansible Roles:

· Reusability: Roles can be reused across multiple playbooks, making it easier to manage and maintain a consistent configuration across different environments.

· Modularity: Roles allow for a more modular approach to infrastructure management, where each role can be used to configure a specific aspect of the system.

· Separation of concerns: Roles allow you to separate concerns between different aspects of the infrastructure, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot issues.

· Improved collaboration: Roles can be shared and reused across different teams, allowing for improved collaboration and knowledge sharing.

· Idempotency: Ansible roles are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely run multiple times without causing unintended side effects or changing the state of the system.

· Standardization: Roles provide a standardized approach to configuring infrastructure, making it easier to maintain consistency and avoid configuration drift.

· Scalability: Roles can be scaled to manage large and complex environments, allowing for automated management of infrastructure at scale.

I had setup Prometheus and Grafana on an EC2 Instance in AWS, First make sure that you have ansible and git installed on your EC2 instance.

These are the only 2 commands you need to setup Prometheus and Grafana using Ansible-roles:

```
ansible-galaxy init prometheus
ansible-galaxy init grafana
```

And then create a sample playbook in that directory by including the above 2 roles of prometheus and grafana.
